I liked this JS gallery so much, it's very small and  simple but when I did this gallery I was  very enjoyed  

it's about changing image src by js using  onclick event == > to change main img when i click on any top images,

and using onmouseover event that helps me to change main img src just == > when I hover on any bottom  images,

I hope you enjoy when you open it like me ğŸ˜Š thank you
